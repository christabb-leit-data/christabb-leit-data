F.01 – Ingest,F.01.1 – CDC Ingestion,Subcomponent,F.01.1,"**Purpose**  
Keep downstream models up to date by continuously replicating source changes (inserts, updates, deletes) into Snowflake with low latency.

**When to use**  
- Operational sources expose change logs (WAL/binlog/redo) or change tables.  
- You need near‑real‑time freshness for analytics, CDC‑based microservices, or event‑driven transformations.  
- Complements **F.01.4 Batch** (bulk, lower frequency) and **F.01.5 Streaming** (event streams).

**Options**  
- **F.01.1.A – SaaS CDC Connector** — Managed service; fastest time‑to‑value.  
- **F.01.1.B – OpenFlow (Native CDC via Log)** — Native log‑based CDC pipeline using OpenFlow.  
- **F.01.1.C – Custom CDC via Log Shipping** — Bespoke CDC for niche/legacy sources; highest engineering overhead.",,,Viable,blueprint;subcomponent;F.01,Update
F.01.1 – CDC Ingestion,F.01.1.A – SaaS CDC Connector,Option,F.01.1.A,"**What it is**  
A managed CDC service (e.g., Fivetran/Hevo/Hightouch) that extracts changes from source systems and lands them in Snowflake. Vendors handle schema drift, soft‑deletes, retries, and scheduling.

**Fit & trade‑offs**  
- **Pros:** Fast start (Partner Connect), low ops overhead, broad connectors, built‑in monitoring.  
- **Cons:** Ongoing licensing/usage cost; less flexibility for niche/custom patterns.

**Typical architecture**  
Source DB → SaaS CDC connector → Cloud stage/queue → Snowflake (landing) → Transformations (e.g., dbt).

**Prerequisites**  
- Security decision: private networking (PrivateLink/Private Link/PSC) vs allow‑list.  
- Destination RBAC (least‑privilege) and dedicated ingestion warehouse.  
- Source table inventory with PKs; FK graph captured from source catalogs for parent‑first DAGs.

**Where to go next**  
- See the **Tasks – F.01.1.A** page for the full delivery plan, dependencies, and handover criteria.",M,,Viable,blueprint;option;F.01,Update
